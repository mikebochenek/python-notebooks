# My various python notebooks
Although I have been writing python scripts and notebooks for some years now, I still feel like a noob.  The other problem is that most of my notebooks are written at work, and I can not share these publicly for legal reasons.

These scripts are from my Digital Ocean instance (/home/mikey/anaconda3/data/python-notebooks)
