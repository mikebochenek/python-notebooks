# My various python notebooks
Although I have been writing python scripts and notebooks for some years now, I still feel like a noob.  The other problem is that most of my notebooks are written at work, and I can not share these publicly for legal reasons.

These scripts are from my Digital Ocean instance - https://jupyter.bochenek.ch (/home/mikey/anaconda3/data/python-notebooks)

| Notebook      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [hello world](/HelloWorldLiterally.ipynb) | to ensure that the setup works and you can access all the libraries |
| [python mastery](/PythonMastery.ipynb) | touch up python scripting skillz |
| [Presto](/PrestoStats.ipynb) | visualization of Presto data |
| [Yakondi](/YakondiStats.ipynb) | visualization of Yakondi data |

## Learning Resources
I have personally used these learning resources, and I am not the only who would recommend these.

1. [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Peter Norvig and Stuart J. Russell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27543.Artificial_Intelligence) - this is a classic book on AI which I studied in 2000 at the University of Guelph while doing my undergrad.
2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurelien Geron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32899495-hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-and-tensorflow) - a very thorough book full of working examples and the best part is that all data and scripts are easily accessible on [github](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
3. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - immersing yourself in theory is important, but at some point you need to start practicing.  In their own words:  Kaggle offers a no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment. Access free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.  My kaggle profile is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mikey320b)
4. [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - this list would not be complete without this brilliant course.
5. more and more resources...
